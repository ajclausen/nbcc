NBCC is a generous community. Please give as much as you are able to help us with our mission of transforming lives in Indiana and beyond. You can easily donate online or contribute during each of our services. “The world of the generous gets larger and larger; the world of the stingy gets smaller and smaller” (Proverbs 11:24). Thank you for your faithful support.

Tithing is a biblical way of worshiping God. Based on the directions in Deuteronomy 12:5-6 we see it is our act of worship to offer back to God some of the blessings He gives us. We want to make tithing as easy as possible and so we have multiple ways for you to give. One of those options is Givelify which is an app that you can download and tithe from anywhere.
