New Brunswick Church of Christ

We believe kids learn more about God when they’re experiencing Jesus in a way they can understand and enjoy. Our ministry offers kids of all ages a safe, gospel-centered environment created just for them.

Youth ages 2 years old to 6th grade will go to the first part of the worship service at 10:00am. Following communion, they will move to the fellowship room where they will have their own class time during the sermon.

Youth group meetings, involving Bible lessons, activities and snacks, are available for all grade school & junior high youth from 5:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m., August-May.  Periodic events are available throughout the summer months. Click here for more information.

Kids will discover important truths in fresh new ways and dig right into the Bible.  At VBS, kids learn one important Bible Point each day, and it's reinforced often through Bible adventures, key Bible verses, songs, dinner, and hands-on explorations that help children know that God is always awesome!
