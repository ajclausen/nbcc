New Brunswick Church of Christ

The NBCC Food Pantry distributes food to those in need the first and third Monday of each month from 9:15 AM to 10:30 AM. If you're in need of food, please come during the food pantry service hours. The Pantry is located at New Brunswick Church of Christ, 6480 South State Road 39, Lebanon, IN.

We provide food to families and individuals throughout Boone County and the surrounding counties. Our ministry offers Love, Encouragement, and Prayers to all that use our Food Pantry. 

Our mission statement for caring and sharing: "The King will reply, "I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers, you did for me." -Matthew 25:40
