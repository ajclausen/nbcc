New Brunswick Church of Christ

Bible Bowl is a quick recall program where students compete over their knowledge of scripture.  A selected book or books of the Bible is determined as the text that season.  A team competes against another team over a selected segment of the text; the team with the most points at the end of the game wins!

Bible Bowl is for any youth in 3rd through 12th grades. We meet every Sunday afternoon to learn God's word in a fun, fast paced adventure. Competitions are once a month where you will be quizzed as team.

Bible Bowl has two seasons per year. The Fall season begins with the school year and has 3 local competitions from September through November, and the Spring season begins after the holidays and has 3 local competitions March through May. There is an optional National Tournament for both seasons: one in early December and one in June.
