ETHEL HARTMAN SCHOLARSHIP

New Brunswick Church of Christ maintains the Ethel Hartman Scholarship fund.  The purpose is to provide scholarships to deserving individuals of New Brunswick Church of Christ to attend one of our Christian church/church of Christ Colleges listed in the Christian Standard. Click here for a copy of that list of Christian colleges.  (Any other or new colleges within the Christian church must be approved by the eldership of NBCC).

New Brunswick Church of Christ wants to encourage our members to further their personal development through Christian education.  Scholarships are available to both undergraduate and graduate students.  Applicants must be an active member for at least one year of the New Brunswick Church of Christ, or a past member of New Brunswick Church of Christ who is presently actively involved in a Church of Christ church elsewhere.

Applications should be delivered to the New Brunswick Church of Christ office.  The missions team will screen applications and submit a recommendation to the eldership for final approval.  The applicant may be required to meet with the missions team and or the eldership at New Brunswick.

All scholarships given will be for one year or one semester only.  Previous year’s recipients may reapply the following year.  Their application must include a copy of their transcript from both semesters of the previous year.  This scholarship is for tuition.  It may also be used for room and board if funds are available.  Scholarships will be paid to the college on behalf of the recipient.
