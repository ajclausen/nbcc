Trail Life USA is a Christian Outdoor Adventure, Character, and Leadership Program for boys and young men. Operating from Troops that are chartered through churches in 48 states, the K-12 program centers on outdoor experiences that build a young man’s skills and allow him to grow on a personal level and as a role model and leader for his peers.  Living the Trail Life is a journey established on timeless values derived from the Bible.
