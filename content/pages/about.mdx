## Faithful Living Since 1856

The Church of God in Christ Jesus at New Brunswick was founded in 1856 by a small congregation in a single room church-house in the tiny town of New Brunswick. More than 150 years later, although the town is gone, New Brunswick Church of Christ continues to preach the gospel and provide community support to our brothers and neighbors.

We are an independent, non-denominational Christian Church committed to Christ and His word. We are dedicated to sharing the love of Christ through ministry, fellowship and worship.

## Our Mission & Vision

**Glorify God** - Our church is not just a house of worship. At its core are the members and believers that come together to practice God's word, celebrate His love and extend His gifts to all.

**The Building Blocks of Our Church** - Our congregation is fueled by a firm belief in the teachings of our Lord, and when we are together under the holy spirit of God â€” we become one.

We welcome you to join our community and discover His power in your life. Don't hesitate to contact us to find out more. We are always open to visitors and new worshippers who want to come and pray among us.

## Our Values

At NBCC, we believe in:

- **Scripture-Based Faith** - We are rooted in the stories of the Bible and believe worship is something that can be expressed in everything we do
- **Christ-Centered Teaching** - Our philosophy is founded on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ
- **Inclusive Community** - No matter who you are, there's a special place for you at our church
- **Active Ministry** - We believe in sharing God's love through practical service to our community
- **Faithful Fellowship** - Growing together in faith through genuine relationships and shared experiences

## More Than a Church

New Brunswick Church of Christ is more than just a place of worship - we're a family. We believe that faith is meant to be lived out in community, where we support one another, grow together, and serve our neighbors with Christ's love.

Whether you're new to faith, returning to church, or looking for a new church home, we invite you to join us and experience the warmth of our fellowship and the power of God's love in your life.
