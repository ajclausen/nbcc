## Spiritual Growth Through Community

By joining our youth ministry, our leaders and mentors work together to build discipleship. Through participation in worship, reading and studying the Bible, and outside mission work, young people will develop a sense of pride. Knowing God and committing themselves to service will inevitably bear good fruit.
