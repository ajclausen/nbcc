The local church is God’s answer to community brokenness and a part of His plan of redemption and restoration. That’s why we mobilize local churches to offer a holistic approach to caring for people in all areas of life: spiritual, mental, emotional, relational, material, and physical.

Hearts for the Homeless is a street outreach ministry.  We believe that in order to assist those without homes we must build relationships.  We believe that God started this outreach and called us to spread His love and to share the true gospel.  Beyond that,  our primary goal is to show all those who are broken that they matter, that they are loved, that they are not invisible.  We believe this is accomplished through consistency, patience, understanding and unconditional love.
