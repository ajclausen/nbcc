New Brunswick Church of Christ

Faithful Living

The Church of God in Christ Jesus at New Brunswick was founded in 1856 by a small congregation in a single room church-house in the tiny town of New Brunswick. More than 150 years later, although the town is gone, New Brunswick Church of Christ continues to preach the gospel and provide community support to our brothers and neighbors. We are an independent, non-denominational Christian Church.

Glorify God

NBCC is an inclusive church committed to Christ and His word. We are dedicated to sharing the love of Christ through ministry, fellowship and worship. Our church is not just a house of worship. At its core are the members and believers that come together to practice God’s word, celebrate His love and extend His gifts to all.

The Building Blocks of Our Church

Our congregation is fueled by a firm belief in the teachings of our Lord, and when we are together under the holy spirit of God — we become one. We welcome you to join our community and discover His power in your life. Don’t hesitate to contact us to find out more. We are always open to visitors and new worshippers who want to come and pray among us.
