# NBCC Website Redesign Gameplan

## Vision
Transform the current NBCC website from a standard template into a captivating, dynamic experience that engages visitors while maintaining excellent usability and staying true to the church's brand colors.

## Design Inspiration (from North City Church)
- **Text Animations**: Implement scroll-triggered text reveals using libraries like GSAP
- **Minimalist Approach**: Clean layouts with intentional whitespace
- **Interactive Elements**: Engaging forms, expandable content sections
- **Visual Storytelling**: Combine imagery with concise, impactful text
- **Playful Graphics**: Add custom illustrations or doodles for personality

## Core Design Principles
1. **Dynamic but Not Overwhelming**: Subtle animations that enhance, not distract
2. **User-Centric**: Easy navigation and clear information hierarchy
3. **Mobile-First**: Ensure all dynamic elements work beautifully on mobile
4. **Performance**: Keep animations smooth and loading times fast
5. **Brand Faithful**: Maintain existing color scheme from church logo
