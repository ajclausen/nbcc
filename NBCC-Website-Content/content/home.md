New Brunswick Church of Christ

A Welcoming Church at the Heart of Indiana

New Brunswick Church of Christ, a congregation in rural Indiana, offers members - and visitors - a chance to become part of something greater. To grow in their love of God and for one another within our beautiful community.

We are rooted in the stories of the Bible and believe worship is something that can be expressed in everything we do. Our philosophy is founded on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. No matter who you are, there’s a special place for you at our church. Get in touch today or come and visit us in person.
